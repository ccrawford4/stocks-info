# Project: Real-Time Stock Data Application on AWS EKS

## Overview
This project showcases the deployment of a Python Flask application on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), utilizing Kubernetes, EKS clusters, and Docker containerization. **The live URL has been suspended for cost purposes. This project will be migrated to AWS Lambda to reduce costs**.

## Key Features

- **AWS EKS Deployment**
- **Kubernetes Expertise**: Demonstrated experience in managing Kubernetes resources, including pods, deployments, and services.
- **Docker Containerization**: Creation of a Docker image for the Flask application, ensuring portability and consistency across environments.

## Technologies Used

- **AWS EKS**: For managing and scaling the application infrastructure.
- **Kubernetes**: As the container orchestration platform.
- **Docker**: For creating a container image for the kubenetes service to use
- **Python & Flask**: The core language and framework for the application.

## Highlights

1. **EKS Cluster Setup**: Configured an EKS cluster using `eksctl` and AWS CLI, streamlining the deployment process.
2. **Docker Image Creation**: Developed a Docker image of the Flask application, optimized for Kubernetes deployment.
3. **Kubernetes Configurations**: Utilized Kubernetes best practices for creating and managing namespaces, deployments, services, and ingress resources.
4. **Load Balancing**: Integrated AWS Load Balancer with Kubernetes, facilitating efficient traffic management.
5. **Service Accounts and IAM**: Leveraged Kubernetes service accounts and AWS IAM roles for secure and efficient access control.
